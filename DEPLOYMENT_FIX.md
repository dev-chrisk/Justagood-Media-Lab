# Image Upload Fix for Live Server

## Problem
Images uploaded in the live version are getting 404 errors because the storage symlink is not properly set up on the server.

## Root Cause
The Laravel storage symlink (`public/storage` â†’ `storage/app/public`) is missing on the live server, causing uploaded images to be inaccessible via HTTP.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Create Storage Symlink (Recommended)
Run this command on your live server (Forge):

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This will create the necessary symlink for image serving.

### Solution 2: Use the Deployment Script
I've created a `deploy.sh` script that includes the storage link command. Run this after each deployment:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Solution 3: Manual Fix via Forge
1. Log into your Forge dashboard
2. Go to your site
3. Open the terminal/SSH
4. Run: `php artisan storage:link`
5. Verify the symlink exists: `ls -la public/storage`

## Verification
After applying the fix, test image uploads by:
1. Going to the "Add Item" page
2. Uploading an image
3. Checking if the image displays correctly

## Additional Improvements Made
- Enhanced the `serveImage` method to include proper caching headers
- Added fallback file serving for better reliability
- Improved MIME type detection for images

## Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ImageController.php` - Enhanced image serving
- `deploy.sh` - Created deployment script
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - This documentation

The fix should resolve the 404 errors for uploaded images on your live server.
